# Mall Management System with Shopping Cart

## Overview

The **Mall Management System with Shopping Cart** is a C++ application built using OpenGL that simulates the management of shops within a mall and offers a shopping cart feature to calculate the area consumed by a player's purchases.

   - Add products to the cart with options for quantity and size.
   - Calculate and display the total area occupied by the products in the cart.
   - Remove items from the cart.

3. **Graphics and Visualization**:
   - Utilizes OpenGL for rendering a graphical representation of the mall layout.
   - Shop icons and products are visually displayed within the mall.
   - Realistic 2D graphics for a seamless user experience.

4. **User-friendly Interface**:
   - Intuitive menus and user prompts for easy interaction.
   - Clear instructions and feedback for the user.

5. **Data Persistence**:
   - Data on shops, products, and cart items is saved between sessions for continuity.
